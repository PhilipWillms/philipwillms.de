firstParagraph: "Before I got into coding I never would have thought that I end up working as a developer because it all just seemed like some black magic to me. Out of curiosity I tried to create my first website just to get a basic understanding of how all of this works. After my first couple html tags and lines of javascript I realized how much fun creating something by writing code can be and I wanted to dive deeper."
